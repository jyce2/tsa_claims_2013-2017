**Business Problem**<br>
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security that has authority over the security of the traveling public. Passengers file claims for injury or property loss or damage that could happen at an airport screening process. Your job is to prepare and analyze TSA Airport Claims and Enplanement data from 2013 through 2017. After you prepare the tables, you create results to answer business questions.<br>

**Deliverables**<br>
Here are the three deliverables that are to be completed by the end of the case study:
|Deliverable |  Deliverable contents|
| -----------|  --------------------|
|Work.Claims_Cleaned| New table that contains the cleaned and prepared data from the claimsraw table |
|Work.ClaimsByAirport | New table created by summarizing claims for each airport and year from work.claims_Cleaned and then joining the summarized data with enplanement (enplanement2017, boarding2013_2016) |
|FinalReport.html | final HTML report produced by running the ReportProgram.sas program on the prepared tables |
